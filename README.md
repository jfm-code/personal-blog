# My Personal Blog

Welcome to my personal blog hosted on GitHub! 

This project serves as a creative space where I share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings on a variety of subjects. While the website is a work in progress, it already embodies a diverse range of features and pages that reflect my personal and professional journey.

## Overview

In its current form, the website is structured as a multi-page platform. However, the long-term vision involves transitioning to a single-page format using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This shift aims to enhance the overall user experience by providing a more seamless and interactive navigation.

The content is meticulously curated, spanning topics such as study/school, work, family, friendship, relationship dynamics, healing, mental health, physical well-being, and more. The diverse range of posts aims to provide valuable insights and perspectives on these crucial aspects of life.

**Key Pages:**
- **About Me**: Explore my achievements since middle school and high school, discover fun facts about me, and understand the motivation behind creating this blog.
- **Posts**: Engage with a myriad of posts covering a broad spectrum of topics.
- **Album & Vlog**: Immerse yourself in family trip albums, relive high school memories, and witness moments from my college journey.
- **Review**: Benefit from recommendations and insights into books, movies, cosmetics, restaurants/cafes, hotels/resorts, and fitness centers.
- **Coding**: Delve into step-by-step guides detailing the development of various projects and my personal coding learning notes.
  
**Special Features:**
- **Search Tool**: Easily locate content on the Home page.
- **Filter Feature**: Streamline exploration with filters on the Post, Review, and Coding pages.
- **Subscription Option**: Stay updated by subscribing to email notifications via the footer.
